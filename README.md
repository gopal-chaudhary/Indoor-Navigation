# Railway Station Navigation System

## Overview

Navigating through complex railway stations can be a daunting task for passengers. Our **Railway Station Navigation System** is designed to transform the passenger experience by providing an intuitive, real-time navigation solution that enhances accessibility, reduces confusion, and streamlines the travel process.

## Problem Statement

Railway stations are intricate environments filled with various facilities such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often struggle to find their way, especially in larger or unfamiliar stations. Our solution addresses these challenges by offering:

- Detailed maps and real-time directions.
- Accessibility options for individuals with disabilities.
- Integration with existing railway services for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Maps**: Utilizing Leaflet and OpenStreetMap, users can explore the station with detailed, immersive 3D maps.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get immediate notifications about platform changes, train delays, and other crucial information.
- **Voice-Guided Navigation**: Designed for visually impaired passengers, our system offers audio instructions and voice commands.
- **Accessibility Options**: Wheelchair-friendly routes, braille options on kiosks, and support for multiple languages ensure inclusivity for all users.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Our custom routing engine tracks user movements and suggests alternate routes to minimize congestion.
- **Open Source and Secure**: With a focus on privacy and data security, our platform is open source and compliant with data protection regulations.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Built using **Ionic** with **Angular** for a seamless user experience across mobile, web, and desktop platforms.

### Backend
